The Jupyter Notebook is written in `Python`, and the following packages are needed to run the code:  
- `PennyLane`:  a cross-platform `Python` library for differentiable programming of quantum computers, which in this tutorial will be used to create quantum circuits and interface them with  
- `TensorFlow`: an open-source platform for machine learning, here used to build a custom model of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- `NetworkX`: a `Python` package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks  
- `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`: standard libraries for array manipulation and plotting
